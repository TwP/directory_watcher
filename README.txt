Directory Watcher
    by Tim Pease
    http://codeforpeople.rubyforge.org/directory_watcher

== DESCRIPTION:

The directory watcher operates by scanning a directory at some interval and
generating a list of files based on a user supplied glob pattern. As the file
list changes from one interval to the next, events are generated and
dispatched to registered observers. Three types of events are supported --
added, modified, and removed.

== FEATURES:

See DirectoryWatcher for detailed documentation and usage.

== REQUIREMENTS:

This is a pure ruby library. There are no requirements for using this code.

== INSTALL:

  sudo gem install directory_watcher

You will need have Mr Bones installed in order to develop or modify directory
watcher.

  sudo gem install bones

== NOTES:

The support for EventMachine based file notifications is fairly new and
experimental. Please feel free to experiment and report any issues on the
github issue tracker.

The support for Rev based file notifications is also fairly new and subject to
the same disclaimer as the EventMachine functionality.
